## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are essential components of computer science and software development. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms in Java.

Each implementation includes comments to explain the underlying concepts behind the implementation.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/arulmozhikumar7/DSA-IN-JAVA.git
```

## Execution

Before executing Java code, ensure that you have Java JDK installed on your system. You can download and install the latest JDK from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html).

After installing Java JDK, you need to set up the environment variables. Follow the instructions specific to your operating system:

- Windows:

  - Right-click on "My Computer" and select "Properties".
  - Click on "Advanced system settings".
  - Click on "Environment Variables".
  - Under "System Variables", find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit".
  - Add the path to the "bin" directory of your JDK installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk16\bin`).
  - Click "OK" to save the changes.

- Linux/macOS:
  - Open your terminal and edit the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file in your home directory.
  - Add the following line at the end of the file:
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/jdk/bin
    ```
  - Save the file and run the command:
    ```
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    or
    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

To compile a Java source file (e.g., `filename.java`), use the `javac` command:

```javac filename.java

```

To execute the compiled Java program, use the `java` command followed by the name of the class containing the `main` method (e.g., `filename` without the `.class` extension):

    ```
    java filename
    ```
